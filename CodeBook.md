==================================================================

>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

>For each record it is provided:
======================================

>- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
>- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
>- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
>- Its activity label. 
>- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

>Feature Selection 
=================

>The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
>'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

#Description of resultant data
1. Means and standard deviation values were extracted and averaged.
2. Base variables extracted had the substrings _mean()_, _std()_, _meanFreq()_, or _gravityMean_, _tBodyAccMean_, _tBodyAccJerkMean_, _tBodyGyroMean_, tBodyGyroJerkMean_ in their names.  The uniqueness function was employed to avoid overlap.
3. It was decided to keep the averaged vectors (gravityMean, tBodyAccMean, tBodyAccJerkMean, tBodyGyroMean, tBodyGyroJerkMean) as in the resultant dataframe they could provide a useful breakdown relevant to the desired dataset, particularly as their exact formulation was not disclosed.
4. To reduce confusion when comparing the source datasets to the resultant dataset, resultant dataset column names were chosen to consist of the source column name with alphanumeric characters removed and the first letter capitalized, prepended by _Avg_.

## Units of measure
1. Acceleration is measured in g's (approximately 9.8 meters per second squared).
2. Angles are measured in radians.
3. A clear basis for frequency calculations can be derived from the author's documentation above.  Not being a mind reader and given what was stated, I am assuming that these numbers are a result of applying an FFT normalized to a -1:+1 range based on some mean on a 50Hz range.
